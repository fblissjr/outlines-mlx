- Just FYI, this is a fork of an early mlx fork of outlines. Was mostly extending it to get it working for a specific use case and to see how much work was required to keep it updated (in short - a lot).
- With mlx adding logprobs support, this type of stuff should be much easier to integrate in the future, either as a new standalone project or integrations into Outlines / mlx: https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/discussions/826#discussioncomment-9739298
